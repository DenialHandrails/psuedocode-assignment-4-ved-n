We will be creating instructions for a card game.

Obtain a deck of cards.
You will need atleast 3 people to make the game fun, also take out all the jokers as they are irrelevant.
First, shuffle the cards and give each player one card.
Leave your first card face up, but do not leave your other cards face up.
The goal of the game is to get a total of 21 or close to it, Aces can count as 1 or 11, face cards as 10.
	If you want another card, say "Hit."
	If you don't want another card, say "Pass."
If you go over 21, you are out.
Keep repeatintg this process until all final players have said "Pass."
After everybody has said "Pass," reveal your cards to see who is closest to 21.
The person closest to 21 is the winner!
